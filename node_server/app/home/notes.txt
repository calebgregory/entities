how does each news source rank?
    SELECT  S.sourceid, S.name, SUM(sv.value)
    FROM sources AS S
    INNER JOIN visitedLinks AS VL
    ON VL.sourceid = S.sourceid
    INNER JOIN associations AS A
    ON A.linkid = VL.linkid
    INNER JOIN sentimentval AS SV
    ON SV.word = A.word
    GROUP BY S.sourceid, S.name
    ORDER BY S.sourceid;
